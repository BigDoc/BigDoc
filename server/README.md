# HackathonBase
##A web application framework for hackathons

A skeleton application with many features used commonly in web applications.

This app contains database controls, a simple authentication system, socket.io configuration, as well as helper methods for serving and storing files.

It is based on express.js, but adds basic features needed for a web application.

The authentication feature is a simple username/password based system, and should not be used in full applications. It is great for hackathons though.

It has been used for Spexy at HackGT, Tracket at Hello World, and will be used in future hackathon projects.
